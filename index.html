      <h1> Race Car Jacket! </h1>
      <p>My Joe Bibbins racing jacket is placed on the wooden clothing rack right next to my bed. Out of all the jackets, it stands out, due to its 
      	<mark> neon green </mark> 
      	quilted patches along the arm and body. The main body of the jacket black and is accented with patchwork logos, with the interior of the jacket being a 
      	<mark> neon green, </mark>
      	 quilted texture.  For years I have been on the search for a racing jacket and I was able to thifted back when I was in New York, reminding me of all the little dreams that came true in the city.</p>
